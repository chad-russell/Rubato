Rubato
======

Rubato is a music application that aims to help musicians learn more about their favorite songs. It uses a custom modified version of the Constant-q transform to extract pitches from the song, and a realtime Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to change the speed of the song without changing the pitch.  Corrections are made to reduce phasiness and also to detect and preserve beats, or attacks.
