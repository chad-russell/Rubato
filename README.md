Rubato
======

Rubato is a music application that aims to help musicians learn more about their favorite songs. It uses a custom modified version of the Constant-q transform to extract pitches from the song, and a realtime Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to change the speed of the song without changing the pitch.  Corrections are made to reduce phasiness and also to detect and preserve beats.
